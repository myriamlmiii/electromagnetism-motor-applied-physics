# Experimental Build: Simple DC Electric Motor ‚ö°

This project demonstrates the design and assembly of a **direct-current (DC) electric motor** using accessible materials.  
The objective was to showcase the **principles of electromagnetism** and evaluate how variations in coil geometry, magnetic field strength, and current source affect performance.

## üîß Materials & Equipment
- Copper wire (enameled, hand-wound into two coils for redundancy)
- Permanent magnets (tested with small, medium, and oversized diameters)
- Conductive supports (copper wire / clips, reshaped to serve as bearings)
- Base platform (wooden block)
- Cables (salvaged, tested for conductivity)
- Power sources:  
  - **Primary:** 2 √ó 4.5 V batteries  
  - **Secondary:** regulated power supply for continuous operation
- Fastening: electrical tape, scissors, pliers

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. **Coil Fabrication**  
   - Two independent copper coils were produced and balanced for rotational symmetry.  
   - Insulation was selectively removed to implement a commutator effect for intermittent current flow.

2. **Support & Base Construction**  
   - Conductive wires were reshaped to act as rotational bearings.  
   - Supports were aligned with a wooden base to minimize friction and vibration.

3. **Magnetic Field Variation**  
   - Magnets of multiple sizes were introduced sequentially.  
   - Comparative testing determined optimal torque vs stability trade-offs.

4. **Power Delivery**  
   - Initial trials with batteries highlighted current limitations.  
   - Transitioning to a regulated supply provided stable current, reducing stalls and voltage drop.

## üìä Results & Observations
- **Rotation achieved** with stable, repeatable performance under regulated supply.  
- **Magnet size comparison:**  
  - Oversized magnet: strong field, unstable rotation.  
  - Small magnet: insufficient torque.  
  - Medium magnet: optimal balance between torque and stability.  
- **Power source comparison:**  
  - Batteries produced intermittent operation.  
  - Regulated power supply enabled sustained continuous rotation.
